## Projects

Here are few projects i'm willing to work on during my weekends and freetime. 

### Energy Management System (EMS)

EMS kit that can be integreted in home / office / industrial facility with ease, without modification in existing facility. It can provide insights about energy consumption data, compared with standard benchmark set, provide analysis and actionable items for energy saving and conservation. 

**Value**: Reduces energy costs, identifies energy wastage, and promotes sustainability.

### Industrial Asset Tracking System
Use ESP32 with RFID or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to track tools, equipment, or raw materials in real-time within the factory/warehouse.

**Value**: Reduces loss of assets, optimizes inventory management, and improves workflow efficiency.

### Industrial HVAC Control System
Implement a smart HVAC system to control temperature, airflow, and humidity based on real-time data.

**Value**: Optimizes energy usage and maintains comfort levels in manufacturing facilities.

### Water Management System

Water flow and level sensors to monitor and control water usage in industrial processes.

**Value**: Reduces water wastage, prevents overflow or overpressure, and promotes sustainable resource management.

### Process Automation and Control

Design & Implement control system for control valves, actuators, and pumps for automated material mixing, dosing, or packaging processes and integrate with existing DCS / PLC systems.

**Value**: Cost effectiveness for small packages, Improves consistency, reduces manual intervention, and boosts productivity.

### Condition-Based Monitoring for Motors

Monitor motor parameters like speed, load, vibrations and temperature and trigger alarms when deviations occur. Design for smaller facilities where cost is important aspect. 

**Value**: Ensures efficient motor operation and prevents unexpected failures.

### Real-Time Production Analytics
Integrate into production lines to collect and analyze data such as production rate, cycle times, downtime, and output rates and develop a daily production report for stakeholders. again, this is for assembly lines of smaller facilities which they want to transition to technologies but resist by price. 

**Value**: Provides actionable insights.
