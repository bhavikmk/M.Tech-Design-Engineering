### Starting with Engineering design from very fundamentals

I'm going through book named "Engineering design: systematic approach" by Pahl. 

### Things to keep in mind

- Have approximate idea of materials by cost, strength and other properties. Not all materials but family of materials. for ex. low CS, Medium CS etc. This will save a lot time during design phase. 

- Good knowledge of Surface Heat treatment for Machine elements (shaft, bearings, gears)
